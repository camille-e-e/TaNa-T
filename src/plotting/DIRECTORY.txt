Useful plotting scripts in this folder:

class_plots.py:
--------------
PLOTS:
	- many
	- abundance, diversity
	- quake frequency, surival probability vs. time and vs. quake number, etc.
	- survival
NPY FILES: 
	- final_stats_{"single" or "var"}-TRC_{date}.npy
	- others


by_spc_plots.py:
----------------
PLOTS:
	- SADs by T
	- skewness of SADs by T
	- quake boxplots by T
	- survival
	- quake frequency vs. survival
NPY FILES:
	- N_by_T
	- D_by_T
	- core_N_by_T
	- core_D_by_T
	- SAD_by_T

final_grid_plot.py: 
---------------
INPUTS: 
	- reads output files of parameter exploration
	- loads survival npy files from class_plots output of single_TRC and var-TRC
PLOTS: 
	- survival, N, and D vs. a number of variables
	- grid plots of survival, N and D (some with TRC overlain)
	- survival of interpolated, single-TRC and var-TRC
OUTPUTS: 
	- predicted_survival_prob_testFeb_09D_init_60.npy: interpolated survival from grid

final_ND_plots.py:
---------------
INPUTS:
	- final_stats_{"single" or "var"}-TRC_{date}.npy # produced by class plots
OUTPUTS: 
	- final N, D vs. T for core and ecosystem as a multi-panel plot

make_final_interaction_plots.py:
------------------------------
INPUTS:
	- outputs of plot_interactions.py (to be run in model output folder)
PLOTS: 
	- mean interactions (including interquartile ranges) and fraction of different interaction types


plot_Topt_poff_fi_etc.py:
------------------------
INPUTS:
	- species_objecst_seed{seed}_{T}K.npy
	- modelrun_seed{seed}_{T}K.npy
OUTPUTS:
	- Topt distribution
	- poff,T distribution
	- poff,T / pdeath distribution (poff,i expected in steady state)
	- fi distribution
	- fi + mu N distribution (mean_j Jij expected in steady state) 

scatter_SAD_stats.py:
--------------------
INPUTS:
	- outputs of by_spc_plots
PLOTS: 
	- Arrhenius plots of N(t), D(t) for ecosystem and core
	- scatter plots of SAD skewness
* TO DO *:
	- make SAD plots of only cloud species
